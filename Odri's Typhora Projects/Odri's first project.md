<h1>Odri's first project</h1>

<p>I'm currently learning how to use Markdown.</p>

This is interesting!  **Now I know the main difference between HTML and Markdown text** 

Some of the markdown texts I know are from _discord_ and _LINE_ text commands



It's already late, and I think I should sleep :sleeping_bed:

Thankyou **Ryoma <3** for teaching me how to Markdown and to use GitHub :smiley:

I will send more links if I have new **Projects** :heart:
